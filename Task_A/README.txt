#This is Task A.
##Data
Dataset contains images and label.csv.
Data_process will generate 3 set of data named: Train_X0.pkl / Train_X1.pkl / Train_X2.pkl / Train_Y.pkl.
X is the three set of images and Y is the label.
Data_show.ipynb will display the composition ratio of image set.

##Models
I use three models in Task A : RF, SVM, MLP.

##figs
Three models will generate .svg pictures which are boxplot to show acc/pres/recall/f1.
